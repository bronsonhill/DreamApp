This leads to the broader question of how free will interacts with fate in a world where ancient myths and advanced technology coexist.\n\nAlongside this, the theme of power and its corruption emerges as a critical issue. The antagonist in the story represents the dark side of power, driven by an insatiable hunger for control over mythical and technological artifacts. This raises questions about the ethical use of power and the consequences of unchecked ambition and greed.
