They need to be well-developed, relatable, and complex. Readers should care about what happens to them. Whether they are likable or not, they must be interesting and have depth. The protagonists should have struggles and weaknesses, as well as virtues and triumphs. The characters should also develop throughout the narrative.\n3. Writing Style: A great novel often has a unique writing style that is both beautiful and effective. This could involve poetic and descriptive language, a distinctive voice, crisp and clear prose, or a unique structure. The writing should evoke emotions and help the reader visualize the story. It is very important that the story is shown rather than told.\n4. Themes: Great novels usually tackle important themes or ideas, giving readers something to think about long after they've finished reading. This could involve deep questions about human nature, society, philosophy, or morality.\n5. Originality/Novelty: A great novel brings something new to the table. It could be an original story concept, a unique setting, a fresh perspective, or an innovative structure or style. It is key that a novel presents the reader a deep and truthful narrative that provokes responses of curiosity, awe, meaning and humility.\n6. Emotional Impact: A great book makes the reader feel something. It could be joy, sadness, fear, anticipation, or any number of other emotions. The key is that it engages the reader on an emotional level.\n7. Universal Appeal: While not all great novels appeal to everyone, the best ones tend to have a certain universal quality. They contain truths or experiences that resonate with many different people, regardless of their background or life experiences. Think of canonical texts, such as the bible, as examples of this."
